library(mrap)
```

The goal of mrap is to provide wrapper functions to reduce the user's effort 
in writing machine-readable data with the [dtreg package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dtreg).
The set of all-in-one wrappers will be covering functions from  ``stats`` and other well-known packages. These are very easy to use, see [Example III: an all-in-one wrapper for anova](#example3).
Mrap also contains wrappers for analytical schemata 
used in the [ORKG-reborn approach](https://reborn.orkg.org/pages/help). This vignette discusses in detail how to apply such a wrapper to write the results of your data analysis as JSON-LD in five steps: 

* Select a wrapper for the schema you will use.

* Check the types of arguments the wrapper requires.

* Create an instance of the schema-related class.

* Modify the instance by setting or correcting its fields manually.

* Write the finalised instance as a machine-readable JSON-LD file. 

## 1. Select a wrapper

To select a wrapper for an analytical schema, please check the [help page](https://reborn.orkg.org/pages/help). For instance, for a t-test you will need a ``group_comparison`` wrapper.   

## 2. Check arguments
The wrappers are very easy in use, when the required arguments are specified correctly, which is crucial for transparent reporting of results. This section explains how to do it.

#### 2.1. Code string {#code_string}
Argument ``code_string`` should be a string (in R, a character vector). The argument cannot be omitted; please indicate  "N/A" if this information is not provided. In [Example I](#example1), we use the following code string:``'stats::t.test(setosa, virginica, var.equal = FALSE)'``

##### Package name
To specify the name of the package in the code is always a good practice. In mrap, we made it a requirement, and you will get an error message if the ``code_string`` does not contain  ``package::function``. In most cases, it is the beginning of the string, but we allow for generic method summary, in this case it is ``summary(package::function(formula))``. For base R, please indicate ``base::``.  

##### Data name
Your data can be a string (URL), a named list, or a data frame (see [Input data](#input) below). In case of a string, you can add the data name manually (see [Modify the instance](#modify)); if your data is a named list, as in [Example I](#example1), mrap easily extracts the elements' names. In these cases, the ``code_string`` does not play a role, and the data name is not specified in it. However, if your data is a single data frame, and you want mrap to extract its name from the ``code_string``, please indicate it as ``'data = dataset_name'``(e.g., ``'data = iris'``), although most R packages allow for merely ``dataset_name``.

##### Target variable(s)
Our wrappers extract the name of a target variable from the ``code_string`` if the variable is before the ``~`` sign in the formula:

```{r}
"package::function(Petal.Length ~ Species), data = iris"
"package::function(iris$Petal.Length ~ iris$Species), data = iris"
```
We also allow for a few target variables in special cases such as MANOVA:

```{r}
"package::function(cbind(Petal.Length, Petal.Width) ~ Species), data = iris"
```
 
Alternatively, a target variable can be explicitly specified in two or more vectors:  

```{r}
"package::function(setosa$Petal.Length, virginica$Petal.Length)"
```
In the following case we cannot extract the name, and you can add the target label manually to the instance: 

```{r}
"package::function(one_vector, another_vector)"
```
You will get a warning reminding to do it. 

##### Level variable(s)
In ``code_string``, level variable is recognized by our wrappers in x|level notation. TODO.

#### 2.2. Input data {#input}

Argument ``input_data`` can be:

* a string, which is either a file name or a URL

```{r}
is.character("ABC")
```

* a dataframe

```{r}
is.data.frame(iris)
```
* a named list for a few vectors or data frames:

```{r}
species_list <- list("setosa" = setosa, "virginica" = virginica)
# check it is a list
is.list(species_list)
# check that the list is named
names(species_list)
```
Please be sure that the argument is one of these three types. You will get an error message if a type is wrong (for instance, a list instead of a named list).

#### 2.3. Test results or named list results

Argument ``test_results`` can be either a data frame or a list of data frames.
You can check whether you are writing down the argument correctly. For a data frame:

```{r}
is.data.frame(iris)
```
 For a list of data frames:

```{r}
# assume you have a few data frames in a list
iris_new <- iris[, -1]
my_results <- list(iris, iris_new)
# check each of them in a loop
for (element in my_results) {
  print(is.data.frame(element))
}
``` 
Argument ``named_list_results`` is only used for the ``algorithm_evaluation`` schema.

## 3. Create an instance

Now when we know which arguments to use, let us create a ``group_comparison`` instance as in [Example I](#example1): 
```{r}
inst_gc <-
  mrap::group_comparison(
    "stats::t.test(setosa, virginica, var.equal = FALSE)",
    list("setosa" = setosa, "virginica" = virginica),
    df_results
  )
```
Here, the ``code_string`` is a string and contains the package name; there is no need for the data name as the ``input data`` argument is specified as a named list; and the ``test_result`` argument is a data frame. 

## 4. Modify the instance {#modify}
For the instance specified above, you will receive a warning message: "Target label is not available, you can set it manually". Let us add the target name:

```{r}
inst_gc$targets <- "Petal.Length"
```
This is how you can add or correct any information after creating an instance.

## 5. Include the instance into the overarching ``data_analysis`` instance {#data_analysis}
The ``data_analysis`` instance should include all analytic instances. 
For one instance:
```{r}
inst_da <- mrap::data_analysis(inst_gc)
```
For more than one instance, use a list:

```{r}
inst_da_all <- mrap::data_analysis(list(inst_preprocessing, inst_regression))
```
## 6. Write JSON-LD {#jsonld}

```{r}
json <- mrap::to_jsonld(inst_da)
write(json, "data-analysis-1.json")
```

## Example I: group comparison{#example1}
Let us assume you conducted a t-test on the Iris data comparing petal length in setosa and virginica species:
```{r}
data(iris)
library(dplyr)
setosa <- iris |>
  dplyr::filter(Species == "setosa") |>
  dplyr::select(Petal.Length)
virginica <- iris |>
  dplyr::filter(Species == "virginica") |>
  dplyr::select(Petal.Length)
tt <- stats::t.test(setosa, virginica, var.equal = FALSE)
```
The results of the test should be presented as a data frame:
```{r}
df_results <- data.frame(
  t.statistic = tt$statistic,
  df = tt$parameter,
  p.value = tt$p.value
)
rownames(df_results) <- "value"
```
Now, let us follow the steps described above to create a ``group_comparison`` instance, modify it, include in ``data_analysis`` instance, and write it as a JSON-LD file:

```{r}
inst_gc <-
  mrap::group_comparison(
    "stats::t.test(setosa, virginica, var.equal = FALSE)",
    list("setosa" = setosa, "virginica" = virginica),
    df_results
  )

inst_gc$targets <- "Petal.Length"
inst_da <- mrap::data_analysis(inst_gc)
json <- mrap::to_jsonld(inst_da)
write(json, "data-analysis-1.json")
```


## Example II: algorithm evaluation {#example2}
To report an algorithm performance, you write the evaluation results as a named list:

```{r}
eval_results <- list(F1 = 0.46, recall = 0.51)
```
Typically, there is no specific line of code to report as ``code_string``, therefore "N/A" is allowed, as explained in the [Code string](#code_string) section above. The data is reported as a URL string: 

```{r}
inst_ae <- algorithm_evaluation("N/A", "data_url", eval_results)
```
You need to add the name of the algorithm and the task manually:

```{r}
inst_ae$evaluates <- "my_algorithm_name"
inst_ae$evaluates_for <- "Classification"
```
This can be further included in the [data_analysis](#data_analysis) instance and written as [JSON-LD file](#jsonld) as explained above. 

## Example III: an all-in-one wrapper for anova {#example3}
Currently, mrap contains an all-in-one wrapper for ``stats::aov`` function, and more such wrappers will be added in the future. Let us assume you are currently using ``stats::aov`` for conducting your ANOVA tests:  

```{r}
data(iris)
anova_stats_results <- stats::aov(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```
The all-in-one wrapper is as easy in use as the original function: 
```{r}
aov <- mrap::stats_aov(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```
The wrapper returns a list, the first element of which is the resulting object from the original function: 
```{r}
anova_mrap_results <- aov$anova
```
The second element is a ``group_comparison`` instance: 
```{r}
inst_gc_anova <- aov$dtreg_object
```
The instance includes all required information. Of course, there is still a possibility to modify it, e.g., to add a label: 
```{r}
inst_gc_anova$label <- "my_fancy_results"
```
This can be further included in the [data_analysis](#data_analysis) instance and written as [JSON-LD file](#jsonld) as explained above.
